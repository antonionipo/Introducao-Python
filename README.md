### üß† **Core Topics Covered**

1. **Introduction to Python**
   - Overview of Python basics, including variables, data types, and operators.
   - Examples of using `print()` for output and `input()` for user interaction.

2. **Control Flow and Conditionals**
   - Explanation of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.
   - Practical exercises, such as validating user input and decision-making programs.

3. **Loops**
   - Detailed use of `for` and `while` loops, with examples like iterating over ranges and lists.
   - Importance of break and continue statements for controlling loop execution.

4. **Functions**
   - Writing reusable functions with parameters and return values.
   - Using functions for modularizing code and improving readability.

5. **Data Structures**
   - Understanding lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
   - Operations like indexing, slicing, and iteration.
   - Exercises involving these structures to reinforce learning.

6. **Advanced Topics**
   - Conditional logic with nested conditionals and logical operators.
   - Transformation of data types using `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.
   - String manipulations, formatted outputs, and best practices.

7. **Practical Exercises and Projects**
   - Challenges such as:
     - Creating simple calculators and games.
     - Working with user inputs to solve real-world problems.
     - Implementing mini-projects that consolidate all learned concepts.
